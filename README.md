#### Project Goals

"How old is your fuzzy friend in human years?"
Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. Every dog owner might’ve heard this rule: one year for Snoopy equals seven years for human. Turns out, the math isn’t that simple. Dogs mature more quickly than we do early on. Here’s how to convert your dog’s age into human years:

The first two years of a dog’s life count as 21 human years. Each following year counts as 4 human years. So a one-year-old dog is 10.5 years old in human years, and a two-year-old dog is 21 years old in human years.

I have written a C++ program called ``dog_years.cpp`` that **take dogs age data from user** and calculate the age, in human years, of any dog older than **TWO=2**.

<h1 align = 'center'> OOP Basic Calculator </h1> 

#### Project Goals
In this project, I've used classes, methods, and objects to create a simple arithmetic calculator. The calculator will be able to:

- Add two integers
- Subtract two integers
- Multiply two integers
- Divide two integers
- Apply the modulo operator on two integers
