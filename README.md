#### Project Goals

We have played Rock, Paper, Scissors, but have you played [Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSHPVCBsnLw)? This is the infamous game brought to popularity with the TV show *The Big Bang Theory*.


Here I have written a `rock_paper_scissors_lizard_spock.cpp` program that:

- Prompts the user to select either Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock.
- Instructs the computer to randomly select either Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock.
- Compares the user’s choice and the computer’s choice and determine the winner.
- Informs the user who the winner is.

Note from the creator, *Sam Kass*:

>"I invented this game (with Karen Bryla) because it seems like when
> you know someone well enough, 75-80% of any Rock Paper Scissors 
> games you play with that person end up in a tie. Well, here is a 
> slight variation that reduces that probability. This version is 
> also nice because it satisfies the Law of Fives."

Lets get acquainted with the game logic:
```r
- Scissors cuts Paper.
- Paper covers Rock.
- Rock crushes Lizard.
- Lizard poisons Spock.
- Spock smashes Scissors.
- Scissors decapitate Lizard.
- Lizard eats Paper.
- Paper disproves Spock.
- Spock vaporizes Rock.
- (and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors.
```

>“A thousand years or more ago, <br>
>When I was newly sewn, <br>
>There lived four wizards of renown, <br>
>Whose names are still well known.” <br>

The [Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogwarts) welcomes everyone! First-year students must go through the annual Sorting Ceremony. The Sorting Hat is a talking hat at Hogwarts that magically determines which of the four school Houses each new student belongs most to:

```
gryffindor
hufflepuff
ravenclaw
slytherin
```

Here I have written a ``sortinghat.cpp`` program that asks the user some questions and places them into one of the four Houses based on their answers!

<h1 align = 'center'> Leap Year Calculator </h1> 



#### Project Goals

Here I have written a ``leap_year.cpp`` program that:

 - Takes a year as input.
 - Checks to see if the year is a four-digit number.
 - Displays whether or not the year falls on a leap year.
 
There are 3 criteria that have been taken into account to identify a leap year:

 - If the year can be evenly divided by 4 then it is a leap year, however…
 - If that year can be evenly divided by 100, and it is not evenly divided by 400, then it is NOT a leap year.
 - If that year is evenly divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.

#### Project Goals

The [Magic 8-Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball) is a super popular toy used for fortune-telling or seeking advice, developed in the 1950s!

Here I have written a ``magic8.cpp`` program that will output a random fortune each time it executes. The answers inside a standard Magic 8-Ball are:

- It is certain.
- It is decidedly so.
- Without a doubt.
- Yes - definitely.
- You may rely on it.
- As I see it, yes.
- Most likely.
- Outlook good.
- Yes.
- Signs point to yes.
- Reply hazy, try again.
- Ask again later.
- Better not tell you now.
- Cannot predict now.
- Concentrate and ask again.
- Don't count on it.
- My reply is no.
- My sources say no.
- Outlook not so good.
- Very doubtful.

For example:
```
MAGIC 8-BALL:
 
It is decidedly so.
```
Or:
```
MAGIC 8-BALL:
 
Very doubtful.
```

#### Project Goals

"How old is your fuzzy friend in human years?"
Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. Every dog owner might’ve heard this rule: one year for Snoopy equals seven years for human. Turns out, the math isn’t that simple. Dogs mature more quickly than we do early on. Here’s how to convert your dog’s age into human years:

The first two years of a dog’s life count as 21 human years. Each following year counts as 4 human years. So a one-year-old dog is 10.5 years old in human years, and a two-year-old dog is 21 years old in human years.

- I have written a C++ program called ``dog_years.cpp`` that **take dogs age data from user** and calculate the age, in human years, of any dog older than **TWO=2**.

<h1 align = 'center'> Space Travel </h1> 



#### Project Goals

Little Mac is an interplanetary space boxer, who is trying to win championship belts for various weight categories on other planets within the solar system.

Here is a ``space.cpp`` program that helps him keep track of his target weight by:

- It will ask him what his earth weight is.
- Ask him to enter a number for the planet he wants to fight on.
- It will then compute his weight on the destination planet.

| No. 	| Planets 	| Relative Gravity 	|
|:---:	|:-------:	|:----------------:	|
|  1  	| Mercury 	|       0.38       	|
|  2  	|  Venus  	|       0.91       	|
|  3  	|   Mars  	|       0.38       	|
|  4  	| Jupiter 	|       2.34       	|
|  5  	|  Saturn 	|       1.06       	|
|  6  	|  Uranus 	|       0.92       	|

#### Project Goals

A traveller just returned from a trip from **South America**. The countries he visited were **Colombia, Brazil**, and **Peru**. He arrived back in the country with some foreign currencies from these three countries.


- Here is a C++ program called ``currency.cpp`` that prompts the user for the amount of each foreign currency. The prompts should look like:

```
 Enter number of Colombian Pesos:
 Enter number of Brazilian Reais:
 Enter number of Peruvian Soles:
```
 
- The program then converts the amount entered by the user and display the total amount of **USD**. The final output should look like:

``US Dollars = $______``

#### Project Goals

In algebra, a quadratic equation is an equation having the form:


#####     *ax^2 + bx + c = 0*

The corresponding x values are the x-intercepts of the graph, while a, b, and c are constants.

<a href=#><img src=https://www.assignmentpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Quadratic-Equation-1-2.jpg /></a>

- Here I have written a C++ program called ``quadratic.cpp`` that solves the quadratic equation for the x‘s:
