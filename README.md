#### Project Goals

"How old is your fuzzy friend in human years?"
Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. Every dog owner might’ve heard this rule: one year for Snoopy equals seven years for human. Turns out, the math isn’t that simple. Dogs mature more quickly than we do early on. Here’s how to convert your dog’s age into human years:

The first two years of a dog’s life count as 21 human years. Each following year counts as 4 human years. So a one-year-old dog is 10.5 years old in human years, and a two-year-old dog is 21 years old in human years.

- I have written a C++ program called ``dog_years.cpp`` that **take dogs age data from user** and calculate the age, in human years, of any dog older than **TWO=2**.

#### Project Goals

In algebra, a quadratic equation is an equation having the form:


#####     *ax^2 + bx + c = 0*

The corresponding x values are the x-intercepts of the graph, while a, b, and c are constants.

- Here I have written a C++ program called ``quadratic.cpp`` that solves the quadratic equation for the x‘s:
